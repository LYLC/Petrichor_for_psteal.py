## Introduction
log2time.py and psort.py are very useful tools for timeline analysis. log2timeline.py can extract timestamps from various system and program artefacts. Subsequently, psort.py can process the timestamps gathered by log2timeline.py to export them in various formats.

psteal.py uses log2timeline.py and psort.py together to gather and process timestamps in one command. Petrichor for psteal.py is a graphic user interface for this tool.

This is an initial release. Although this program is functional, it doesn't support all psteal.py's functions yet. Use it as is. Please feel free to reach out to me if any bugs are found.

## Requirements
Plaso is not included in this program. Please install it prior using this program.
